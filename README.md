# Study Time Tracker

This simple Python program helps you estimate how many hours you will study in a week based on the number of hours you studied today. The program asks for your daily study hours, calculates the projected weekly total, and displays it clearly. It also includes basic error handling to prevent crashes if a non-number is entered.

## How to Run

Navigate to the project folder, then run:

```bash
